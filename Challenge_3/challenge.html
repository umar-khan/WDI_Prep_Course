        <p>The actual content inside is 200px wide. The text is padded by 20px left and right, and 10px top and bottom. It has a dotted border 2px thick.</p>
        <p>This box has the same exact CSS styles applied to it, the distance between the two boxes is 30px. Overlap between margin is a thing.</p>
